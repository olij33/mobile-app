    <h1 id="277da7ac-472e-e92e-3046-f58a5cbf61d5"><meta charset="utf-8" /><span>RWW LDP Mobile App with WebCredits</span> </h1><h2 id="3e910738-55aa-9d6d-f92f-9fb36d4df1b4">About</h2><h3 id="9fadbef1-5cd6-bc53-7a55-21b7a97322f9">BACKGROUND</h3><p>Working with W3C Community groups around Read-Write Web.  We’re building W3 Standards Compliant distributed Linked-Data Read-Write Cloud storage system/s.  My frustration with these systems, is that the it is near impossible to show others how they work due to the difficulty in signing-up.</p><p>At the moment; to write a card [1] someone needs to type it out in Turtle.  Most people don’t know what turtle is, and the problem continues. The object with this open-source project, is to build something that is useful, easy to use &amp; hopefully popular as to create new opportunities in developing the decentralised web-community, encouraging interest in developing new applications, etc.</p><p><br /></p><h2 id="7e982958-35a4-daab-56bf-1457ee271372">FUNCTIONS OF THE APP</h2><p>The first function is to support the creation of RWW[2]/LDP[3] accounts.  This is done by creating a FOAF Profile in relation to a WebID[4].  A number of these RWW platforms exist, from henry’s RWW-PLAY [5], to Kingsley’s ODS / OpenLink Software [6] and the various solutions built by the team in MIT [7].</p><p style="">The current easy examples are written in PHP [8][9] providing an array of application examples, such as a Calendar [10], Microblogging application [11][12] and continuing examples of address book [13][14] which demonstrates how data stored and retrieved semantically, in a format that can be searched on the web [15] and a file-browser [16]</p><p>Beyond the proof of concept work in using these platforms, melvin[17] and ‘webized’[18] Bitcoin [19][20][21] which now needs a method to store the private key, and create transactions between parties.  In-turn, the use-case more particularly, is to facilitate the use of a ‘web credit’ as a stamp, enabling people to use currency (in the form of ‘web credits’) in association to sharing on the web.  The initial outline was posted [22] in july where it is that in essence, i’m seeking the initial development of an app (that supports the USE-CASE 3: WebCredits ) on a mobile device, as to support the storage of a private key.</p><p>The theory being that in the first instance - a user may ‘like’ or otherwise create a number of transactions.  they may create a setting that allows these transactions to be verified immediately (upto a certain amount, or amount per day, etc.) or may wait until they goto their phone and authorise transactions at a latter time.  The WebCredits system includes ACL’s (access control) which is controlled via WAC[23].  if a resource is not available until a payment has been made, this can be controlled via WAC.</p><p>The underlying premise, is that people will be able to share resources, obtain URI’s for resources to be shared, create a stream of information that might share content with CreativeCommons associations[24][25] or form groups on projects [26][27] where stakeholders contribute, approve, deny and develop new software whilst being recognised for their work in the form of web-credits, which in-turn forms a type of ‘proof of stake’[28] but in relation to a products development.  </p><p>At the moment - in the first iteration - i’m simply looking to create a mechanism that does not (yet) allow for the creation of new projects (multi-actor entities) but rather, start with the basics.</p><p>So, this would include;</p><p>1. A Personal Profile with Addressbook function</p><p>1.1 The ability to create friendship groups</p><p>1.2 the ability to change what information is displayed to what group (i.e. family might see home phone, business friends might see mobile phone or different email)</p><p><br /></p><p>2. The ability to support a WebCredits Wallet </p><p>2.1 create a public/private key compatible with the block-header for WebCredits</p><p>2.2 the ability to sign a web credit</p><p>2.3 the ability to send a web-credit to someone if your address-book</p><p>2.4 the ability to attach a web credits request to an asset, or give web credits in relation to an action.  </p><p><br /></p><p>IE: </p><p>- you can see this picture for $0.0001 web credits </p><p>- i decide i will give you $0.00001 WebCredits when i like your microblog post or $0.0002 if i decide to share it</p><p><br /></p><p>3. Microblogging</p><p>Cimba [11] / kima [12] demonstrate a basic microblogging platform.  Here[29] are some examples of how that data is stored. This [30] gives you some information on how to read/write to the data space.  An example of an application that is being used for Instant messaging (as apposed to posting) is here [31] however i’m not sure atm about whether we’re simply creating different types of messaging; and therefore, perhaps ‘microblogging’ is ‘channel based’ whereas IM is a private type of communication…</p><p><br /></p><p>4. GIS data</p><p>In terms of a format to store location information - here [32], however i feel it’s important that when this data is made public - we provide an option in the address book / friendship groups section to lower the resolution of the GPS data via Freebase [33] or similar.</p><p><br /></p><p>I feel it’s important to identify where the user is: and store that data, so that if a users android device (i.e.: phone) goes missing, they’re able to identify where it has been if (or when) it’s been doing transactions.  I think it is achievable in the first instance to present an interface to the user that shows them, where they’ve been, etc. However this should be provide data.</p><h3><strong>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</strong></h3><p>IMAGE MANAGEMENT:  We’ll need to be able to manage media content.   In the first instance, images - the ability to create a master / derivatives and use settings on the phone to select whether the master is uploaded on 3G or WiFi connections to the phone.</p><p style="">This functionality will be extended to manage other forms of media, such as Audio and Video files. </p><h3>CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT</h3><p>In the first instance, no e-commerce (meaning a form of national currency instrument) will be used.  However, part of the authentication system will be using a WebID (TLS Certificate) in association to a Persona (FOAF documents).  Persona Documents can be stored on different CloudStorage Servers (i.e.: RWW.io  / Data.fm, etc.) with the same WebID TLS Certificate. </p><p>NOTE:  in latter versions i plan to enable a method to create your own RWW websites (i.e.: http://your.name ) and support credentials https://identus.org/  which in-turn should support http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2010/Papers/IAB-privacy/httpa.pdf and an array of https://web-payments.org/ other similar applications.  i note that the difference relates to international identity related requirements…</p><p><br /></p><h3>TAGS - NFC + 2D Barcodes</h3><p>I would like to progressively store TAGS (info about ‘things’  linked to 2d barcode / NFC Chip identifiers) in the RWW DataSpace.  These tags will be linked to ontological information about the device, which may be used for authentication purposes, support for the device (i.e. updating bios in tv), event management, etc. </p><h3>MULTIPLE FOAFS</h3><p>FOAF documents have different areas, such as Person, Group, etc.</p><p>TODO: Figure out how to make groups, and assign permissions to participants of a group, dedicated to some task.</p><p>ie; webcivics leadership, webcivics australia, webcivics andoid app, microblogging channel, website, etc.</p><p>BRANDING: the app will be branded via WebCivics initiative.</p><h1>TOOLS / Existing Android Code</h1><h2>FOAF/WebID Provider &amp;
